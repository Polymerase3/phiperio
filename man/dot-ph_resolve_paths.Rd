\usage{
.ph_resolve_paths(
  exist_file = NULL,
  fold_change_file = NULL,
  samples_file = NULL,
  input_file = NULL,
  hit_file = NULL,

}
\arguments{
\item{exist_file, fold_change_file, input_file, hit_file, samples_file, timepoints_file}{Character paths (relative or absolute) to the respective CSV/Parquet inputs.
\code{NULL} means "not supplied".}

\item{extra_cols}{Character vector of extra metadata columns to keep; may be
\code{NULL}.}

\item{output_dir}{Ignored (soft-deprecated).}

\item{config_yaml}{Optional path to a YAML file whose keys mirror the
function arguments; relative paths inside the YAML are resolved against the
YAML’s own directory.}
}
\value{
A named list with absolute paths, \code{extra_cols}, and \code{base_dir};
suitable for downstream helper functions.
}
\description{
Combines explicit arguments with a YAML config (if given),
expands every relative path to an absolute path (relative paths are
evaluated against \code{dirname(config_yaml)} (!!!) when YAML is used, otherwise
against the directory that contains the first supplied data matrix (!!!)),
and returns a fully populated list of file locations and options ready for
downstream conversion. Only cheap, load-blocking checks are done here:
\itemize{
\item \code{input_file} and \code{hit_file} must be supplied together or both omitted.
\item At least one matrix source (\code{exist_file}, \code{fold_change_file}, or the
\code{input_file} + \code{hit_file} pair) must be present.
\item Deprecated \code{output_dir} triggers a soft warning.
}

All deeper table-content validation is deferred to \code{phip_data} class
validation.
